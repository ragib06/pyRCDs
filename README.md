# Relational Causal Model and Tools

This library provides an up-to-date implementation of Relational Causal Model [[1](#1),[2](#2),[3](#3),[4](#4)], which provides classes for presenting relational schema, skeleton, and ground graphs.
RpCD, a sound and (only) complete structure learning algorithm [[4](#4)] is developed with theoretical evaluation in mind.
To learn a causal structure from real data, please check out a separate library [`RRCD`](https://github.com/sanghack81/RRCD), robust relational causal discovery [[5](#5)], which is dependent on this library developed by the same author.
